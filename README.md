## TO DO

### General
- css for pages is aligning page content to the left leaving blank space on right side **must have**

### PWA
- need pwa related files like manifest.json and a service worker

### pages
- about page should have info on the issue we are aiming to solve
- queue page needs to have a visible queue ticker and a rough time estimate of when to go to the hospital, as well as the name of the hospital you are attending **must have**
  - maybe need some sort of location tracking question to facilitate this **must have**
    - this may be easier to implement with pwa related features 
- home page clean up and add button to immediatly enter the queue and redirect to   queue page **must have**

### backend 
**currently all backend tasks are tabled**
- decide on backend tech (most likely going to use express)
